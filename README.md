# FLIP fluid simulation project

This repository is for release purpose only. The advancement of the project can be seen there https://github.com/Eymeric65/3DFlipFluidTIPE.

During the year of 2019 and 2020, I have had the opportunity to work on a fluid simulator project.

This project was based on three major assets : [Fluid Simulation SIGGRAPH 2007 Course Notes](DOCS/Ressources/Fluid_note.pdf), [Fluid Simulation Using Implicit Particles](DOCS/Ressources/Flip.pdf) et [Implicit Density Projection for Volume Conserving Liquids](DOCS/Ressources/Pressure.pdf).

Based on these documents, I could write my own theoric paper about my FLIP fluid simulation  : [Th√©orie](DOCS/theorie.pdf) (French only)
